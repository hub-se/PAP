# Property Adaptation Patterns (PAP)

This repository contains code for our Property Adaptation Patterns.
Our replication package contains all the code used throughout our evaluation. Additional README files provide information to setup Arduinos, if necessary. 

## Replication Package
This repository contains the code to
* determine how much memory (SRAM) an Arduino has
* our observer implementations as well as a Timescales implementation to generate online traces. The observer templates also determine how much memory (SRAM) the observer uses
* determine how much time an our PAPs use compared to redeployment
* evaluate how fast events can be processed
* demonstrate our PAPs on the BSN

For more general information on the PAPs, we refer to our wiki: https://github.com/hub-se/PAP/wiki.
